## Code Overview (Programming Language: C++)

**Technical Skills Implemented:**

- **Data Structure:** The code uses a `map` to store tasks and their statuses (completed or pending).

- **User Input:** It takes user input for task-related operations.

- **Conditional Statements:** The code utilizes `if` and `switch` statements to manage tasks based on user choices.

- **Looping:** The program is implemented as a loop, allowing users to perform multiple tasks without restarting it.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the code, you need a C++ development environment. Follow these steps:

1. Save the code to a file with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `todo_list.cpp`).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the code is saved.

4. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): `g++ -o todo_list todo_list.cpp`.

5. Run the compiled executable: `./todo_list`.

Enjoy managing your tasks with the To-Do List Manager!

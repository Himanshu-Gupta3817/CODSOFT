## Code Overview (Programming Language: C++)

**Technical Skills Implemented:**

- **User Input:** The code uses `cin` to take user input for numbers and the chosen operation.

- **Conditional Statements:** It utilizes a `switch` statement to select the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the user's choice.

- **Looping:** The calculator is implemented as a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the code, you need a C++ development environment. Here are the steps:

1. Save the code to a file with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `simple_calculator.cpp`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the code is saved.
4. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): `g++ -o simple_calculator simple_calculator.cpp`
5. Run the compiled executable: `./simple_calculator`

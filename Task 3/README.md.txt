This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. Two players can play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The game allows players to take turns, input their moves, and checks for a win or a draw.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in a C++ environment.
2. The game will display instructions and a 3x3 grid with cell numbers.
3. Players take turns: Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O".
4. To make a move, enter the cell number corresponding to the position you want to mark.
5. The game will display the updated board after each move.
6. Continue taking turns until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
7. The game will announce the winner or declare a draw.
8. After each game, you can choose to play again.

## Code Overview (Programming Language: C++)

**Technical Skills Implemented:**

- **User Input:** The code uses `cin` to take user input for player moves and choices.

- **Conditional Statements:** It utilizes `if` and `switch` statements to check for winning conditions, draw, and player turns.

- **Arrays:** A 2D array is used to represent the game board.

- **Looping:** The game is implemented as a loop, allowing players to continue playing without restarting the program.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the code, you need a C++ development environment. Here are the steps:

1. Save the code to a file with a `.cpp` extension (e.g., `tic_tac_toe.cpp`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the code is saved.
4. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): `g++ -o tic_tac_toe tic_tac_toe.cpp`
5. Run the compiled executable: `./tic_tac_toe`

## Enjoy Playing Tic-Tac-Toe!

Challenge your friends to a game of Tic-Tac-Toe! Take turns marking the grid with your "X" or "O" and try to be the first to get three in a row. The game is both fun and strategic, and you can play as many rounds as you like. Have a great time playing!
